    <h3>About Me</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="item item-body item-text-wrap">
    <p>Hello, Bonjour. My name is Michel Beaubien. I have come a very long way since high school. Over the years, I have matured, I have grown. Everyday is a new and exciting challenge, another bump to get over. Knowledge is everything in this industry, I want to learn more, I need to learn more. My passion is in Web Coding/Designing. Hire me. You will not be disappointed. I am a bilingual Canadian. Small town guy, nothing fun ever happened, had to make your own fun. That meant a lot of days spent by the beach. Enough was enough, it was time for a change. I packed up and moved to London. That fall I started my first year of Interactive Media Design and Production at Fanshawe. Change is good. Change is needed.</p>

  		<h2>Just Eventzz - 2015 / Present</h2>
  		<p>For this website, I am not the original developer. I was brought on after the site was live. Since then I've been asked to do minor CSS changes. The client and I are in touch to make this website a true eye catcher.</p>

  		<h2>Paradise Properties - 2015 / Present</h2>
  		<p>This was a nice little project to get my fingers going! Simple yet elegant design, I took advantage of the "Sea-Side"colours. I put in anywhere from 40 - 60 Hrs, more late nights, not complaining. The client wanted a website to display his skills in photography. I bring the paradise to you. I learned many new things, I hope you enjoy browsing!</p>

  		<h2>Forrat's Chocolates - 2015</h2>
  		<p>I took part in a team base project, five of us took charge in completing separate tasks. I was the front-end developer for this website. I was responsible for writting all of the HTML &amp; CSS for this website, including all of the Javascript &amp; jQuery functionalities. This website took four months to complete. Forrat's Chocolates was a great success!</p>

  		<h2>Beyond The Beach - 2014 / 2015</h2>
  		<p>This website is for a None Profit Organization. I worked very closely with the client to guarantee absolute satisfaction, via Email &amp; Skype. Working for free, as a student, due dates and meetings, it was a great experience. I was the Front-End developer for this website, but I was also responsible for the design &amp; functionalities.</p>

  		<h2>Tycrete Construction - 2014</h2>
  		<p>I was asked by a friend to create this website as a Christmas gift. Start date was November &amp; I had the website complete a few weeks before Christmas. The client was thrilled to receive the website, they loved how the colours of the logo came together with the website. In the new year, I was asked to do extra functionalities for the Portfolio page, &amp; to make it mobile. This was my first freelance website.</p>
